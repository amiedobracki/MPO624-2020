# Calendar of class actions and assignments 
### MPO/ATM 642, spring 2020

week | Tuesdays (theory) | Thursdays (computers) | dates
-----|----------|-----------|------
1 | no meeting: reading assignment for next week | no meeting | AMS week 
2 | Assignment: Create a [hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/start/) account and install their Chrome plugin. Now, create some annotations on these **3 readings: 1.** [**What is science?**](https://www.nap.edu/read/13163/chapter/4) Opine on what it says. **2.** [**p-values explained simply**](https://towardsdatascience.com/p-value-explained-simply-for-data-scientists-4c0cd7044f14). Did you know this? Have any questions? Any debates? **3. An open-source research paper of your choosing.** Focus your attention and comments on the *experience of the key quantitative evidence (table, graph, image), **not** on the content of the scientific claims.* Specifically, what is the clinching observation *that the reader makes on the page?* A number is different from zero? A number is big, or great, or small, or greatly negative? | The art of working toward the middle. For the backwards part, examine student annotations from **3.** above. Then browse plot galleries of [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/gallery.html), [bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/gallery.html), [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html), [holoviews/geoviews](https://holoviews.org/gallery/index.html), [altiar](https://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/index.html), [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/plot-gallery.html), Igor's plots, [Unidata examples](https://unidata.github.io/python-training/gallery/gallery-home/); or from a Jupyter .ipynb [gallery](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-Jupyter-Notebooks), or others. Learn to mix and match with `jupyter lab` drag and drop demo.  | Jan. 21-23
3 | Assignment: 3 more directed readings on science and evidence. **Make annotations as you read. Then, in my discussion questions at the end, write some response with links to your specific annotations as needed. We will look at these in class as a discussion.** [1. Intro chapter to System Identification](https://weather.rsmas.miami.edu/bmapes/http/pagestuff/system-identification-intro_sw.pdf), [2. Excerpt on the history of statistics from The Book of Why](https://weather.rsmas.miami.edu/bmapes/http/pagestuff/BookOfWhy_excerpt_sw.pdf), and [3. The method of multiple working hypotheses](https://www.whoi.edu/cms/files/chamberlin65sci_72744.pdf). Lecture/handouts: begin on Notations and Nomenclature, gathering key concept+term pairs for exam and applications. | Assignment (clearing the pipes of our online communication): Combine parts from 2 codes (one for data ingest or generation, and one a gallery-quality plotting code). To do this in Jupyter, after [installing](https://github.com/MPOcanes/MPO624-2020/blob/master/INSTALL_JUPYTER_UNIDATA.md) the Unidata python-training suite, learn to drag-n-drop in `jupyter lab`. Make the whole code work (`import` packages as needed). Upload to your fork of the course repo so we can look at these in class.  | Jan 28-30
4 | TA lecture on terms you must understand deeply: *covariance*, *correlation coefficient r in [-1,1]*, *least-squares fitting*, *explained variance r-squared*, *regression coefficient* (has units), *variance and std. deviation*. Understand the asymmetry of regression, unless data are *standardized* |  Regression exercise in Jupyter notebook. Do [this word problem](https://github.com/MPOcanes/MPO624-2020/blob/master/Testable_material_oldexams/WordProblemHeatFlux.pdf), due as a homework. Demo on regression with two inputs (“predictors”). https://www.fast.ai/|  Feb. 4-6
5 | More readings, by Oreskes: [Why Predict](https://hyp.is/srZSuEOdEeqlBl_p3KC1nQ/weather.rsmas.miami.edu/bmapes/http/pagestuff/Oreskes_2000_Why_Predict_sw.pdf), and [The nature of quantitative models in science](https://hyp.is/DuzL7EK-Eeqw39Nhxkms3g/history.ucsd.edu/_files/faculty/oreskes-naomi/Role%20of%20quantitative%20models.pdf).  Here is a nice [blog survey of AI/ML](https://vas3k.com/blog/machine_learning), and a nice [MindNode mindmap](https://github.com/dformoso/deeplearning-mindmap). [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) has good basic ML in the Python ecosystem, [examples](https://scipy-lectures.org/packages/scikit-learn/index.html#examples-for-the-scikit-learn-chapter). https://www.fast.ai/| Read [Denby paper](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019GL085190), and consider also the [Reichstein review](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-0912-1), this short [EOS piece](https://eos.org/opinions/thoughtfully-using-artificial-intelligence-in-earth-science), or this on [interpreting NNs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.01752.pdf). Flag terms needing clarification in class (are they [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_artificial_intelligence))? This will help us to be hands-on ready for next week. | Feb 11-13
6 | Machine learning w/ Leif Denby. Laptop exercises: I. replicate and revise the clustering of encodings (the dendrogram in his Fig. 2). II. Apply the trained NN to new input images. | On a bigger computer (TRITON): See how to train a new NN from any 11,000 256x256 image tile triplets you might assemble. | Feb 18-20
