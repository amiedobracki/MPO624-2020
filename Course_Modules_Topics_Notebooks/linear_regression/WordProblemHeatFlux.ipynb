    "\n",
    "When you put a pot of water on a heated stove, the water convects. The temperature at the top of the pan increases because a vertical mass flux $\\rho w$ carries specific enthalpy $C_p T$ upward, comprising an energy flux $\\rho C_p w T$ which we can summarize by its *kinematic temperature flux* wT. \n",
    "\n",
    "To study this flux, you set up a vertical anemometer to measure w, and a thermometer to measure T, in the mid-depth of the pan. The devices collect the following statistics, where the overbar is a time average that you may assume is the same as a spatial average over the area of the pan: \n",
